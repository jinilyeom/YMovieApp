# YMovieApp
This is an android movie app built entirely with Java.
Trying to understand android architecture basic.
I started project with Java, but I am gonna convert to Kotlin and Jetpack Compose later.
I hope someones helpful this project.

## Architecture
YMovieApp references the [official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).
Itâ€™s so hard to understand because I referenced every single project is different.

## TMDB
You need to TMDB API keys.
- [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs)

## Do next
Will be development with:
- Kotlin
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Jetpack Compose
